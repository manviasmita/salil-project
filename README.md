## Adding angular material 
    ng add @angular/material
    
## Desc

# After adding angular/material, we shifted our angular material code(imported modules) in a separate module name as  MaterialModule.

# First, we created 3 left menu, and on click on the menu, displaying header using flag (showNavHeader).

# We are using angular material for displaying header and sub header, accordian can be another option as well.
    $$ I would suggest to revisit https://material.angular.io/components/categories for more information on how to use material components.

# This much code I am pushing on git and we will modify so many lines down the line.

    ## TO do list 

    # We will create many components for routing so that on header selection, we will render router view based on selection 
    # we will use *ngFor for both header, and nav selection
